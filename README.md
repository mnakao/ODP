## How to create libraries
```
$ cd src
$ make [serial|threads|mpi|mpi_threads|cuda|mpi_cuda|all]
```
 
## How to run sample programs
```
$ cd sample
$ make [serial|threads|mpi|mpi_threads|cuda|mpi_cuda|all]
$ ./general.x ./graphs/general/n16d4.edges
Nodes = 16, Degrees = 4
Diameter     = 3
Diameter Gap = 1 (3 - 2)
ASPL         = 1.9166666667 (230/120)
ASPL Gap     = 0.1833333333 (1.9166666667 - 1.7333333333)
```

## Graph file format
* A graph file must be in an edge list format compatible with the NetworkX's read_edgelist function. Edge attributes will be ignored if exist.
* For a general graph, each vertex name must be an integer starting from zero.
* For a grid graph, each vertex name must be a comma-separated string like "x,y" (no quotes, no spaces). x and y are integers starting from zero, which represent the coordinate of the vertex.
* Please see sample graphs in `./samples/graphs/` or http://research.nii.ac.jp/graphgolf/submit.html

## Environment variable
### APSP=[NORMAL|SAVING]

This library provides two types of APSP algorithms.
One is `NORMAL`, the other is `SAVING`. `SAVING` is a memory-saving version.
By default, `NORMAL` is automatically selected if the amount of memory used is
lower than the value of `MEM_THRESHOLD` in `src/parameter.h`.
This environment variable can specify the algorithm to use.

### APSP_PROFILE=1

Output the performance profile.

### Initialize for a graph with symmetry
These functions can be used instead of the apsp_init\* functions for only a general graph with symmetry.

```
void apsp_init_s         (int nodes, int degree, int num_degrees[nodes], int groups)
void apsp_cuda_init_s    (int nodes, int degree, int num_degrees[nodes], int groups)
void apsp_mpi_init_s     (int nodes, int degree, int num_degrees[nodes], MPI_Comm comm, int groups)
void apsp_mpi_cuda_init_s(int nodes, int degree, int num_degrees[nodes], MPI_Comm comm, int groups)
```
* [IN] nodes : Number of nodes in a graph
* [IN] degree: Degree in a graph
* [IN] num_degrees[nodes] : Specify NULL for a regular graph. If not, specify the degrees for each vertex.
* [IN] comm : MPI communicator
* [IN] groups : Numer of groups in a graph with symmetry. This value must be a divisor of nodes.

Symmetry in this software means that when the vertices are arranged on a circle,
the graph when rotated by `360/groups` degrees and the graph before rotation match.
Please see `samples/graphs/general/n24d4g4.edges` and `samples/graphs/general/n24d4g4.png` as an example of (nodes, degree, groups) = (24, 4, 4).

![](./misc/img/symmetry.png)

This image is a `samples/graphs/general/n24d4g4.edges`, and is divided into four ( = the value of `groups`).
For example, the values on the 1st row are 22 and 15.
The number of them plus 6 ( `= nodes/groups`) matches the 1st row in the next group (in line 10).
Here, 22 + 6 = 28, but the number of nodes is 24, so it goes around and becomes 28 - 24 = 6.

There is also an exception if the value of `groups` are even.
The edge with vertex numbers 4 and 16 in the 3rd line is the diameter across the center of the circle.
Specifically, the value obtained by subtracting the vertex numbers is half the number of nodes.
The difference between the 3rd and 12th lines is exactly 6, but the difference between the 12th and 21st lines is not 6.
This is because if the difference between the 3rd and 21st lines is 12, the lines will overlap.
In such cases, the edge list is devided into two large groups.
One group consists of the 1st to `groups/2`th group, and another group consists of the remaining groups (`groups/2+1`th to the last group).
Within each group, the difference between the vertices should be `nodes/groups`.

## Note
The software also supports non-regular graphs, but usage of memory may be not efficient.
Because the format of the adjacency matrix is `int adjacency[nodes][degree]`, which is commanly used in regular and non-regular graphs.
This wastes memory when the number of edges that each vertex has varies greatly.
